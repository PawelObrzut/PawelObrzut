Greetings!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Pawel Obrzut, and I'm thrilled to have you here. This platform serves as a documentation of my coding journey and a showcase for my latest projects.

Ever since I discovered coding, it has become my true passion. Over the years, I've pursued it as a hobby, and now I'm making the exciting transition into a full-time role as a full-stack developer. Looking back, I wish I had dived deeper into coding earlier in my career!

Currently, my expertise lies primarily in JavaScript/TypeScript. I feel confident using Express Node to construct robust backends, and React for frontend development. When it comes to managing state, I typically employ the Context API, but I'm also well-versed in Redux, Toolkit, and Zustand.

Additionally, I possess a strong understanding of both relational databases like SQL and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB. I'm proficient in using Docker for containerization, and I utilize Jest and Mocha for testing applications.

Continuously honing my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest libraries and npm packages is always a priority for me. Presently, I'm dedicated to learning GoLang, and I can't wait to integrate my newfound skills into future projects!

Thank you for visiting, and feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to get a glimpse of my coding endeavors.
